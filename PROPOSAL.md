## Overview

The Australian National University provides a publicly accessible directory,  
The directory contains staff or university affiliates who opt to be listed.  

We plan to Pull all records that are linked to a uniID from the directory,  
mapping relationships between the individual and the organization,  
this will allow us to visualize the footprint the ANU has from an human resource  
perspective using the publicly accessible data,  
we also will look for other potentially interesting relationships  
between individuals such as common roles.

The data will be organized and used to produce a DiGraph using Networkx
while we hope to be able to produce the data dynamically,
if there are performance impacts from querying the ANU directory,
we will look making the contacts collector script an independent script,
while providing instructions in a NOTES.md file as to how to utilize it.

## Data
